# AdrianPinon.github.io

The purpose of the repository is showcase my portfolio! I now understand why this is important. 
Not only will this showcase what I've done but also what I am capable of doing and 
how far I've come since the beginning. 


## Motivation

The motivation behind a portfolio is to demostrate to the world (and fellow coders)
your abilities to work code. At its heart, it might give someone an idea of where to start
for their own project or portfolio. It never ceases to amaze me how far I've come. Of course, I've just 
start my journey into the world and it terrifies me and excites all in the same time.

## Credit

HTML5up.net was the framework of the portfolio. I love minimalist style and movement the user experiences as they scoll through my work.
